# PredictiveAccuracy

## Predictive Accuracy Testing in Predictive Regression Models 

Description: This R package aims to implement predictive accuracy statistical testing for nested environments of predictive regression models. Further, extensions of the proposed testing methodology includes the following: 

- Predictive Accuracy Testing in Cross-Sectional Regressions using Lasso-type regularization.
- Predictive Accuracy and Parameter Instability Testing in Predictive Regressions.  

## Installation (under development)

The R package ‘PredictiveAccuracy’ will be able to be installed from Github.
